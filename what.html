            <p class="large">Please check out their website. They are an art school that will teach you how to make stuff, like this website. They paid me to make it for you so you might click to their website and eventually say "hey, why not? might as well, what's the point anyway," and so on.<br></p>
            <p class="large">This site contains a typeface written in p5.js. It is available through an open-source license, meaning that you can not only use this website to generate and export whatever typographic compositions you want, but you can also copy the website itself, which is basically a jumbled up typeface and home brewed text editor, and do whatever you with that too. Hopefully, for beginnerâ€“intermediate creative coding people, this will be a nice entry point for object-oriented p5 typography programs, and provide a framework for reducing processing load.</p>
