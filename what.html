            <p class="large">Please check out their website. They are an art school that will teach you how to make stuff, like this website. They paid me to make it for you so you might click to their website and eventually say "hey, why not? might as well, what's the point anyway," and so on.<br></p>
            <p class="large">This page contains a typeface written in p5.js. It was kind of difficult to figure out font export due to some limitations in other dependencies. But anyway it makes some cool images and SVG is right around the corner. It's open-source, available here on Github. Hopefully, something in the parametric grid approach or object-oriented glyphs will be somehow helpful. I hope you all get A's on your tests.</p>
