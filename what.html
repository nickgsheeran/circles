            <p class="large">It urges young creatives to question how one can go about making things today. This website is a tool for making, but the act of making this tool for use in the act of making was done pretty much for the sake of it, so it was a silly artistic act leading, hopefully, to a few more.<br></p>
            <p class="large">This site contains a typeface written in p5.js. <a class="p-link" href="https://github.com/nickgsheeran/mica-type">It is available here,</a> through an open-source license, meaning that you can not only use this website to generate and export whatever typographic compositions you want, but you can also copy the website itself, which is basically a jumbled up typeface and homemade text editor, and do whatever you want with that too. Hopefully, for beginnerâ€“intermediate creative coding people, this will be a nice entry point for object-oriented p5 typography programs, and provide a framework for performance improvement via event-based switches for the draw loop.</p>
